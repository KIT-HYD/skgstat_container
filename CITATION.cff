  This repository contains a docker image for geostatistical data processing using standardized input and outputs. 
  This is based on the template for a generic containerized Python [tool](https://github.com/vforwater/tool_template_python). 

  Currently, there are three tools implemented:

  1. Geostatistical variogram estimation
  2. Kriging interpolation
  3. Geostatistical simulation

  In order to run an interpolation or simulation,you need to provide a valid variogram first. The variogram tool is accompanied
  by extensive plotting to validate its geospatial robustness. 
  Variograms can be calculated for spatially distributed samples, or spatially dense fields. You need to provide either of 
  both inputs. If a field is used, it is highly recommended to subsample it instead of resolving all coordinates into a sample.
  The tool defaults to a maximum sample size of 1000, which can be disabled by setting the sample_size parameter to -1.
